## Summary: Turn Your HYROX Sled Push into a Weapon

Rich Ryan (2x Elite 15 World Championships qualifier, 54:28 PR, 175 lbs competition weight) shares how he went from 4-minute death march sled pushes to consistent low 2-minute pushes. Three factors: training, technique, and race day strategy.

## Part 1: Training

### Frequency

**Optimal: 2x per week**

Rich experimented with 4x/week and found:
- Overfatigue and wear on lower legs, feet, calves, Achilles
- Combined with running volume = too much stress
- Going through the motions instead of attacking with intensity

Strength training responds better to intensity than volume. Two quality sessions beats four mediocre ones.

### Structure

One session should be **straight sets and reps** — treat it like strength training.

**Total volume:** Keep under 150 meters per session.

Key principle: The goal is to move the sled FAST. Structure training to allow high-quality, high-intensity efforts.

### Intensity Variation

Venue conditions vary dramatically:
- Humidity, heat
- Carpet age
- Sled condition

**Train at different loads:**
- Heavier days
- Lighter days

Counter-intuitive: faster-moving sleds can feel worse because you lose the micro-rests that heavier sleds force. Prepare for the unknown by training across the intensity spectrum.

## Part 2: Technique (Instant Gains)

Technique changes give immediate results — the only way to get instant improvement.

### Hand Position

**Palms facing forward** (away from you) on the poles.

Common mistake: Wrapping hands around poles eliminates the option to push with arms. Forward-facing palms let you use arm drive.

### Forearm Position

**Forearms flush against the poles.**

Mistake: Turning arms out and leaning poles against upper biceps. Uncomfortable and removes pushing advantage.

### The Hooks Technique

Major advantage: moves hips and feet closer to the sled.

- Closer = more force into the object
- Hips/feet far away = harder to get traction, increased distance between power source and object
- Shoulder-height pushing is fine if needed, but practice hooks for several weeks

### Stride Length

No universal answer — take whatever steps let you move as fast as possible.

- Longer strides if they maintain speed
- Shorter strides if needed to keep sled moving

**Test it:** 4 x 15m at Pro weight, time each approach (long strides vs short strides), compare RPE and actual times.

## Part 3: Race Day Strategy

The sled push has the widest variance between great and poor execution. Massive time gains possible — but also race-ending if mismanaged.

### The Classic Mistake

Feeling good → hammer the sled → everything crashes at burpee broad jumps. Can't express full fitness potential because you blew up in the first third.

### The Solution: Control Surrounding Stations

Keep these controlled:
- Run before ski
- Ski erg
- Run before sled
- Run after sled

**Express high output on the sled itself** while keeping bookend efforts conservative. You'll make up time later when others are dying.

Going against competitor instincts to chill early is hard — but crucial for best overall race.

### In-Station Execution

Have a plan before you touch the sled:
- Quantitative: "Push to halfway, rest 5 seconds, push to 3/4, rest 5 seconds, finish"
- Qualitative: "Push until legs feel like they're about to blow up, then rest"

**Rest duration:** 5-10 seconds is fine if it allows faster overall push.

**Critical:** Stay on the sled. Don't back away during rest. Maintain contact the entire time. Intent and presence matter.

## Bottom Line

| Factor | Key Points |
|--------|------------|
| **Training** | 2x/week, under 150m volume, vary intensity, treat like strength work |
| **Technique** | Palms forward, forearms flush, hooks position, test stride length |
| **Strategy** | Control surrounding stations, express power on sled, have a rest plan, stay on the sled |

The sled push is where you can save the most time — or blow up your race. Train it properly, nail the technique, and execute a smart race plan.
