## Summary: Nick Bare — Lessons Learned Training for First HYROX

Nick Bare (2:39 marathoner, Ironman finisher, 100-mile ultra runner) shares what he's learned preparing for HYROX Dallas as a new challenge in hybrid athlete training.

## His Current Weekly Training Split

| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Monday | 10 easy miles | HYROX circuit |
| Tuesday | — | Upper body + core |
| Wednesday | Tempo/track (10-12 mi) | Lower body strength |
| Thursday | 10 easy miles | HYROX circuit |
| Friday | 8 easy miles | Upper body + core |
| Saturday | Long run | Accessory work |
| Sunday | 8-10 easy miles | — |

**Weekly mileage:** ~65 miles

## Lesson 1: HYROX Is a Running Race with Obstacles

The race is 8km of running (just under 5 miles) — roughly half the race duration. But it's not regular running, it's **compromised running**. Each functional station breaks down the body, so every subsequent 1K gets harder. The challenge is running on fatigued legs while managing heart rate variability.

---

## Lesson 2: Training Sessions Must Be Purpose-Driven

Early in prep, Nick was "dart throwing" — randomly selecting movements, assigning rep schemes, and picking durations without clear intent. That doesn't work.

Every circuit needs a defined purpose:
- Compromised running practice
- Engine building
- Specific skill/movement work

The purpose drives the program structure.

## Lesson 3: Stimulate, Don't Obliterate

Easy to crush yourself every session. But burying yourself daily digs a hole you can't climb out of.

**"Consistently good rather than occasionally great."**

The goal is stimulating adaptation, not just surviving hard workouts. Anyone can obliterate — being smart enough to stimulate growth is the skill.

## Lesson 4: Fuel Your Training or Fall Behind

Lighter is faster — but **underfueled is ineffective**.

If nutrition doesn't meet energy and recovery demands, you regress. Nick tracks:
- Total daily calories
- Nutrient timing around workouts
- 1g protein per pound bodyweight
- Carbs + electrolytes around training

**Pre-run protocol (4:30am):**
- 2 scoops G1M Sport + 1 GoBar
- ~800mg sodium + 76g carbs

"Once you train fueled, you'll never train fasted again."

## Lesson 5: Auto-Regulation Is Critical

With this much physical demand, you must adjust training based on how you feel and perform.

**Objective data:** Apps, devices, metrics
**Subjective data:** How do you actually feel?

Auto-regulation methods:
- Off days
- Deload weeks
- Swapping tempo runs for easy runs
- Any adjustment that prevents digging a hole

The awareness to make changes keeps progress sustainable.

## Lesson 6: Track Your Progress

Nick uses a physical notebook to log everything daily:
- Run splits, paces, heart rate, volume
- Afternoon workout details (exercises, reps, sets, weights, time)
- Subjective notes on how body feels
- Calorie intake

This enables progressive overload tracking across three modalities (strength, running, circuits). HYROX is essentially a triathlon-type sport — lots of variables to monitor.

## Bottom Line

HYROX demands structured, purpose-driven training with smart recovery management. Coming from pure endurance, the integration of circuits requires intentional programming rather than random hard efforts. Fuel properly, auto-regulate, and track everything.
