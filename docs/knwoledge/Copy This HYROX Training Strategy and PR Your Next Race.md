## Summary: Copy This HYROX Training Strategy and PR Your Next Race

Rich Ryan (3x HYROX Elite 15 World Championships qualifier, 54:28 PR) provides a systematic approach to building a HYROX training program from scratch.

## Key Principle: Plan Backwards From 2 Weeks Before Race

Your training goal should be accomplished **2 weeks before race day**, not on race day. The final 2 weeks are for taper and recovery. If your race is 12 weeks out, your peak training happens at week 10.

---

## Step 1: Set the Right Kind of Goal

**Wrong approach:** Outcome-based goals (specific finish time)
- Hard to project
- Sets up frustration
- Can destroy confidence

**Right approach:** Training-based goals
- Example: "60 minutes of HYROX effort at high output"
- Example: "60 minutes at Zone 4 in a HYROX workout"

Everything in your program then points toward that training goal.

## Step 2: Build Your 7-Day Training Week

**Priority 1: Aerobic work (5 of 7 days)**

Aerobic function is the most important component for both elites and beginners. You can't squeeze it in — it requires intentional time allocation.

**Priority 2: Rest (start with 2 days)**

Common mistake: cramming too much work into one week. Works short-term, leads to injury/burnout long-term.

**Reality check:** 5 days/week for 3 years beats 7 days/week for 3 months.

**Priority 3: Strength (optional, in remaining days)**

Strength can be maintained through HYROX-specific conditioning if you already have a base (decade of lifting/CrossFit). Add dedicated strength only if:
- You need to build required strength for stations
- You want to maintain physique
- It doesn't replace aerobic work

**Priority 4: Additional aerobic work (cautiously)**

Can add a 6th aerobic day, but be careful — low intensity work lets you complete sessions even when overcooking yourself. Add gradually. Consider non-running options (cycling, swimming, machines) to reduce injury risk.

## Step 3: Structure Quality vs Easy Days

Of your 5 aerobic days:

| Day Type | Quantity | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Quality sessions | 1-2/week | 30-70 min HYROX-specific work at threshold |
| Easy/Zone 2 | 3-4/week | Steady state, RPE 5-6, stay below Zone 3 |

Quality sessions ride the aerobic/anaerobic line. Easy days build base capacity.

## Step 4: Progression Strategy

**Example:** Goal = 60 minutes high-output HYROX work, 10 weeks to achieve it.

Starting from zero: add 6 minutes of quality work per week.
- Week 1: 6 min
- Week 2: 12 min
- Week 3: 18 min
- ...continuing to 60 min at week 10

**Critical rule:** Small incremental jumps, not big chunks. Starting at 40 minutes means you'll be dragging by minute 20 and won't hit quality output.

**The goal of training is to hit your workouts.** Miss one → miss the next in progression. Make it challenging but doable.

**What to progress when:**
- 8-12 weeks out: Progress quality session duration (priority)
- Beyond 12 weeks: Can progress strength or running volume to build base, then layer intensity on top

Don't try to progress everything simultaneously — pick one focus at a time.

---

## Step 5: Deload Weeks

**Recommended:** Every 3-4 weeks, reduce volume and intensity by ~30%

**Not always necessary if:**
- Recovery metrics look good (resting HR, sleep)
- Feeling good
- Workouts progressing

**Why it matters:** Most people push through warning signs until burnout. Planned rest raises your ceiling even when it doesn't feel like progress.

## Weekly Structure Summary

| Component | Days | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Aerobic work | 5 | Non-negotiable priority |
| Rest | 2 | Protects longevity |
| Quality sessions | 1-2 | Within the 5 aerobic days |
| Easy/Zone 2 | 3-4 | Within the 5 aerobic days |
| Strength | Optional | Add only after aerobic needs met |

---

## Bottom Line

1. Set training-based goals, not outcome goals
2. Aerobic work takes priority (5 days minimum)
3. Rest is non-negotiable (2 days)
4. Quality sessions (1-2/week) progress incrementally toward goal
5. Finish peak training 2 weeks before race
6. Deload every 3-4 weeks
7. Progress one thing at a time
