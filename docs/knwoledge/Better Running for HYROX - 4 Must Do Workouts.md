## Summary: 4 Must-Do Running Workouts for HYROX

A breakdown of the four essential running sessions to improve HYROX performance, plus how to structure them in a training week.

---

## Workout 1: Aerobic Threshold Intervals (High-End Zone 3)

**The most effective running workout for HYROX.**

- Intensity: High-end Zone 3, just below Zone 4 threshold
- RPE: 8/10
- Pace: What you could hold for a 10K to 10-mile race (1 hour)
- Rest: 1/4 of work duration (very short)

**Why it works:**
- HYROX is primarily an aerobic event despite feeling intense
- You need to sustain effort for ~1 hour = must be aerobic
- Running slightly faster than race pace improves mechanical efficiency
- Short rest ensures you stay in the aerobic zone

If you need more rest, you're going too hard and leaving the aerobic zone.

## Workout 2: Low-End Zone 3 Intervals

**Closest to actual HYROX race pace.**

- Intensity: 70-75% max HR / 90-95% lactate threshold HR
- Pace: Half marathon race pace
- More volume than threshold work
- More continuous efforts

**Example workout:** 3 x 1 mile with 400m jog recovery

**Why it works:**
- Feels most similar to actual race pace
- Allows more time on feet
- Builds familiarity with sustainable race effort
- Higher volume than threshold sessions

## Workout 3: Mechanical Fartlek (Zone 2)

**Improves running efficiency — how well you move.**

- Intensity: Easy/Zone 2
- Structure: 2 min perfect form running / 2 min relaxed (repeat)
- Focus: Mental work on mechanics, not physical strain

**Key mechanical cue:** Foot strike should land as close to hip as possible. Most common error is overstriding (foot landing too far in front of hips).

**How to improve:**
- Watch runners you want to emulate (pro runners, elite HYROX athletes)
- Record yourself running
- Practice during easy Zone 2 work

**Why it works:**
- More efficient = less energy expended
- As positions become familiar, they become less taxing
- Mechanical improvements compound over time

## Workout 4: Long Run (Zone 2)

**The overlooked session that builds muscular endurance.**

- Intensity: 65-75% max HR / 80-90% lactate threshold HR
- RPE: 5-6 (conversational pace)
- Target duration: 70-90 minutes (build up 5 min/week from wherever you start)

**Why it works:**
- Improves muscular endurance (critical for HYROX)
- Builds aerobic capacity
- Adapts body to running volume on concrete
- Improves recovery from hard workouts

**Common issue it solves:** Cramping at end of races, extreme soreness post-HYROX = not enough accumulated running volume/muscle damage adaptation.

Running requires longer durations at low intensity to build endurance (unlike wall balls/lunges where intensity creates adaptation quickly).

## Sample Training Week

| Day | Session |
|-----|---------|
| Monday | Low-end Zone 3 intervals |
| Tuesday/Wednesday | Mechanical Zone 2 (form work) |
| Thursday | High-end Zone 3 aerobic threshold |
| Friday | Off/other training |
| Saturday | Long run |
| Sunday | Off/other training |

**Key principle:** Don't stack run days back-to-back. Allow recovery between each running session while fitting in other HYROX training.

## Bottom Line

HYROX is an aerobic event. The four running pillars:
1. Aerobic threshold (fastest adaptation)
2. Low-end Zone 3 (race pace familiarity)
3. Mechanical work (efficiency gains)
4. Long run (muscular endurance + aerobic base)

Don't neglect long runs just because they're boring — they solve the cramping and soreness issues most athletes experience.
