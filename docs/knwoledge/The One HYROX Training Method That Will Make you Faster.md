## Summary: The One HYROX Training Method That Will Make You Faster — Threshold Training

Rich Ryan (3x HYROX Elite 15 World Championships qualifier, 54:20 PR) breaks down why threshold training is the single most important method for HYROX performance.

## What Is Threshold Training?

A catch-all term covering anaerobic threshold, lactate threshold, and ventilatory threshold 2. These markers all converge at one point of effort.

**Practical definition:** The fastest pace you can sustain for the longest time.
- Go further → must slow down
- Go faster → can't accumulate enough volume

**Physiologically:** The point where lactate production exceeds clearance rate. Cross that line and fatigue spikes, limiting further work. Training just below it builds fatigue resistance.

## How to Identify Threshold

| Marker | Threshold Zone |
|--------|----------------|
| Heart rate | Low Zone 4 |
| RPE | 8/10 |
| Race equivalent | 45-75 min effort (depending on conditioning) |
| Feel | Hard but doable |

## Standard Application: 5:1 Work-to-Rest Ratio

From endurance sports: 5 minutes work → 1 minute rest.

**Self-calibration:**
- Need more rest than allotted? → Went too fast
- Don't need the rest? → Didn't go hard enough

There's a sweet spot that becomes clear after weeks/months of consistent threshold work.

## Adapting for Machine Work (Ski, Row, Bike)

On machines, muscular fatigue and skill become limiters before cardiovascular threshold. Solution: **shorten intervals** (1-3 minutes) to maintain intensity.

Running should have higher volume than machine work — HYROX is a running event. Quality machine sessions should be pulled back relative to running.

## Why HYROX Requires Longer Threshold Bouts

Standard running events don't race at threshold:
- 5K/10K = faster than threshold
- Half/full marathon = slower than threshold

HYROX races *at* threshold for 45-90 minutes. Short intervals (3-5 min) don't replicate that feeling — heart rate drops during rest, then rebuilds each interval, missing sustained adaptation.

**HYROX-specific recommendation:** Start intervals at **10 minutes minimum**.

Even better: sustained threshold efforts of 20-50 minutes moving through stations + running. No intervals needed — just sit in the zone continuously.

## Workout Structure for HYROX

**Ramping approach:**
- First 10-12 minutes: gradually build into threshold
- Then sit in threshold zone for extended duration
- Combine running with station work to extend time at threshold

**Why this works:** Builds fatigue resistance and teaches you what sustained discomfort feels like across transitions — exactly what race day demands.

## Programming Guidelines

| Variable | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Frequency | 1-2 sessions per week |
| Starting duration | Conservative (build up) |
| Weekly progression | +5 minutes per week |
| Weekly threshold volume | 30-100 minutes (varies by athlete) |

**Don't:** Jump straight to 60-90 minute threshold sessions just because that's race duration.

**Do:** Start lower, sustain higher output, progressively build. Find what's recoverable for you.

## Bottom Line

If Rich Ryan had to reduce training to one thing that moves the needle most, it's threshold training. For HYROX specifically:
- Longer sustained bouts beat short intervals
- 10+ minute efforts minimum
- Build up progressively
- 1-2 quality sessions per week with proper recovery
