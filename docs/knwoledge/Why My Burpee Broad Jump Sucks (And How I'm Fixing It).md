## Summary: Hunter McIntyre — Burpee Broad Jump Training Analysis

This is a training vlog from Hunter McIntyre (multiple-time HYROX World Champion) breaking down his weakness in the burpee broad jump station and how he's addressing it.

## The Problem

Hunter used to complete the burpee broad jump station in under 2 minutes. Now he's hitting around 3 minutes. His hip pop off the ground has deteriorated, and he's losing explosiveness on the return portion of each rep.

**Key observation from reviewing race footage:**
- Ski erg: crushed it
- Sled pull: could be better
- Sled push: fine
- Burpee broad jumps: major weakness
- Farmer carry: fine
- Lunges: need work
- Wall balls: already doing high volume (100-120 reps in training)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue isn't the jump distance — it's the **getting up off the ground** portion. Specifically:

1. **Hip pop is slow** — the explosive hip extension from prone to standing has degraded
2. **Fatigue pattern** — on the way back, his hop disappears completely
3. **Movement breakdown** — when tired, he shifts into a slower "half CrossFit burpee" pattern instead of explosive pop-up

Being tall means fewer total jumps needed, but the individual rep quality matters more. A big broad jump sucks too much air — consistency beats max distance.

## Training Fixes Being Implemented

**Weight vest work:**
- Weighted push-ups
- Weighted air squats
- Goal: overtrain the movement so unweighted feels explosive

**Core/posterior chain:**
- GHD sit-ups for the get-up-off-the-ground explosive pattern
- Back extensions
- Focus on abdomen strength for the hip pop

**Technical focus:**
- Feet straight (not externally rotated)
- Don't go into the slow half-burpee pattern
- Keep legs up, avoid dropping into compromised positions
- Consistent hop distance rather than max effort jumps

**Interval structure:**
- Minute on/minute off burpee broad jump intervals
- 5 rounds with coaching feedback between sets
- Analyzing each round for where movement breaks down

## Other Training Context

Week 2 of a training block. Current program includes:
- 6x6 minute running intervals (morning)
- Heavy cleans (building to 245-255 lbs)
- Gym station intervals
- Body recomposition focus (diet phase)

## Bottom Line

The burpee broad jump is a limiter for Hunter despite his dominance in other stations. The fix is building explosive hip extension through weighted movement prep, core work, and high-volume practice with technical feedback. The goal is to get back to that "crazy frog hop" pattern he used to have.
