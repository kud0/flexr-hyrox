Here's the breakdown:

## Core Framework: The 6-Zone Model

The video builds everything around training zones expressed as % of FTP (Functional Threshold Power) — your max sustainable pace for ~30-40 minutes.

| Zone | Target | Work Time | Work:Rest | Key Adaptations |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Zone 2** | Aerobic base | 40-90 min | 20:1 or continuous | Mitochondrial density, fat oxidation, capillary density |
| **Zone 4** | Threshold | 30-50 min | 5:1 or 10:1 | Sustained metabolic stress tolerance |
| **Zone 5** | VO2max | 15-25 min | 2:1 or 1:1 | Maximal aerobic power |
| **Zone 6** | Sprint/Anaerobic | ~10 min | 1:5 | Phosphocreatine resynthesis, neuromuscular recruitment |

## Key Insight: CrossFit WODs Are Less Aerobic Than You Think

A study on "Cindy" (20-min AMRAP: 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 15 air squats) found participants only hit **64% of VO2max** — moderate intensity, not threshold. The reason: functional movements have built-in micro-rests between reps, so a large chunk of energy comes from anaerobic sources even when you feel gassed.

**Implication:** If you want to train aerobic capacity with functional movements, you need continuous, low-technical movements at low RPE (3-4). Going "all out" in AMRAPs doesn't equal aerobic training.

## Practical Workout Examples

**Zone 2 (Functional Fitness version):**
- Airbike at RPE 3, accumulate 210 cals
- Every 2 min: 6 alternating DB clean & jerks (light) + 4 easy burpees

**Threshold (Functional Fitness):**
- 3 x 10-min AMRAP, 2 min rest between
- 10 burpee pull-ups → 40m walking lunges → 15 light wall balls
- Keep it continuous, non-technical, whole-body

**VO2max (Functional Fitness):**
- Every 8 min x 4 rounds:
- 15 cal bike + 12 power snatch (medium) + 15 pull-ups + 15 wall balls + 15 burpee over bar
- Goal: finish in 4-5 min, rest the remainder

**Sprint/Zone 6 ("WOD Science Classic"):**
- Every 4-5 min x 4 rounds:
- 12 cal airbike (men) / 9 cal (women) + 10 heavy wall balls + 10 jumping lunges
- All out — takes 45-60 sec, rest long

## Recovery Implications

Higher intensity = more recovery needed. The video emphasizes that understanding this is why periodization matters:
- **Far from competition:** More zone 2, base building
- **Closer to competition:** Threshold → VO2max → sprint intervals

**Bottom line for programming:** Stop defaulting to "all out AMRAPs" for everything. Manipulate intensity and work:rest ratios to target specific adaptations. Zone 2 and threshold work require intentionally dialing back intensity — which most CrossFit athletes never do.
