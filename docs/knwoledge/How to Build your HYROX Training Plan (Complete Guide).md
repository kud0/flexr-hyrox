## Summary: How to Build Your HYROX Training Plan (4-Step System)

A clear framework for structuring HYROX preparation using a "building a house" analogy.

## Step 1: Phases (Construction Schedule)

Training moves in waves, not constant escalation. For a 12-week prep:

| Weeks | Focus | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1-4 | Base building | Easy endurance, light strength, build engine, adapt to volume |
| 5-8 | Build | Intensity increases, heavy strength + HYROX-specific movements |
| 9-10 | Sharpen | Race-specific work, simulate competition demands |
| 11-12 | Taper | Volume drops, stay sharp, arrive fresh for race day |

**Deload guidance:** Fitness theory says every 4 weeks take it lighter. Reality: if you're still fresh, keep pushing. If you're cooked, drop volume and focus on technique.

**Universal principle:** Build → Sharpen → Peak → Race

## Step 2: Framework (Building Blocks)

The house structure:

**Foundation:** Strength + Endurance (without it, nothing stands)

**Walls (two sides):**
- Threshold training — hard but holdable pace, teaches race pace sustainability
- Intervals — short painful efforts that push your ceiling higher

**Roof:** HYROX-specific work — runs, stations, transitions connected as they'll appear on race day

---

## Step 3: Loading (Weekly Structure)

**Core rule:** No back-to-back hard days. Always put easy/recovery between.

**5-day week example:**

| Day | Session Type |
|-----|--------------|
| Monday | Strength |
| Tuesday | HYROX-specific (stations + transitions) |
| Wednesday | Rest |
| Thursday | Strength |
| Friday | Threshold work at race pace |
| Saturday | Rest |
| Sunday | Long endurance session |

**Intervals:** Stack after strength workouts (running intervals or wall ball finishers for aerobic capacity)

**Scaling:**
- 4 days available → Combine strength into one full-body session
- More time → Swap rest day for easy endurance session

**Progressive overload example:** Threshold sessions increase distance through phases (600m → 800m → 1000m, etc.)

---

## Step 4: Form (Body Type Slider)

Imagine a slider: Strength ←→ Endurance

**If you're already strong:** Slide toward endurance — running will be your limiter. Replace a strength session with additional endurance work.

**If you're fast/light but weak:** Slide toward strength — stations will eat you alive. Add more strength focus.

**As race day approaches:** Slider moves toward center for balance.

The principles are universal, but the slider position is individual.

## Recap

1. **Phases** = construction schedule (peak at the right time)
2. **Framework** = foundation, walls, roof (balance and stability)
3. **Loading** = weekly room layout (theory into daily training)
4. **Form** = body type slider (adjust to your individual needs)
