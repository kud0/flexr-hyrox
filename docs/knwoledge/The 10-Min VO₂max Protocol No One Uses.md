This completes the trilogy nicely — now you've got the full picture on interval protocols.

## What is Repeated Sprint Training (RST)?

Micro-intervals with **insufficient rest**:
- 3-10 second all-out sprints
- 30-60 seconds rest (not enough to fully recover)
- Power drops with each sprint due to phosphocreatine (PCr) depletion

This is different from Sprint Interval Training (SIT) where you go 30 seconds all-out but rest 4-5 minutes (full recovery).

## The Physiology: Why Sprints Become Aerobic

The key insight: **phosphocreatine can't fully resynthesize** between sprints.

- Sprint 1: ~85-90% energy from PCr stores
- Each subsequent sprint: PCr contribution drops, aerobic contribution rises
- By sprint 5-6: athletes hit VO2max despite doing "sprints"

PCr resynthesis requires oxygen — so your aerobic system gets taxed even during anaerobic work. This is why RST can boost VO2max.

## Meta-Analysis: Which Interval Type Wins for VO2max?

A 2024 Chinese meta-analysis (51 studies, 1,261 athletes) compared protocols:

| Protocol | Effect Size (Hedges G) | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|-------|
| **RST** (Repeated Sprint) | 1.04 | Large effect |
| **HIT** (Norwegian 4x4 style) | 1.01 | Large effect |
| **SIT** (30s sprint, 4-5 min rest) | 0.7-0.8 | Moderate effect |
| **Continuous training** | Lower | Least effective short-term |

**No significant difference between RST and HIT** — but RST takes ~10 minutes vs 25-30 for Norwegian method.

## The Long-Game Caveat

Short-term studies (5-7 weeks) favor HIT/SIT. But longer-term data shows:
- Endurance training builds more capillaries
- Capillary density = better oxygen delivery to muscles
- Over 12+ weeks, endurance training catches up and may surpass HIT alone

**Takeaway:** You need both. HIT/RST for fast VO2max gains, endurance work for sustained long-term adaptation.

## Practical RST Protocol

**10-minute VO2max session:**
- 10 x 10 seconds all-out
- 50 seconds rest
- Done.

Or the WOD Science challenge protocol:
- 6 x 20 seconds all-out (Concept2 rower or bike)
- 80 seconds rest

## Bonus: Athletic Profiling via RST

Power drop-off pattern reveals fiber type dominance:

| Profile | First Sprint | Drop-off | Interpretation |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Athlete A** | Very high | Steep decline | Fast-twitch dominant, poor aerobic recovery |
| **Athlete B** | Moderate | Flat line | Slow-twitch dominant, good aerobic recovery |

You can use this test to understand where a client sits on the power vs endurance spectrum.

## Synthesis Across All Three Videos

Now you've got a complete interval framework:

| Zone/Protocol | Work Time | Work:Rest | Best For |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Zone 2 | 40-90 min | Continuous | Volume accumulation, recovery, capillary density |
| Threshold | 30-50 min | 5:1 / 10:1 | Sustained metabolic stress tolerance |
| VO2max (HIT) | 15-25 min | 1:1 / 2:1 | Maximal aerobic power |
| SIT | ~10 min total | 1:5 | Phosphocreatine resynthesis, neuromuscular power |
| **RST** | ~10 min total | 1:4-1:8 (insufficient) | VO2max + anaerobic capacity in minimal time |

For your clients and retreats, RST could be a killer addition — it's time-efficient, brutal, and works both systems. Perfect for busy entrepreneurs who want max adaptation per minute.
