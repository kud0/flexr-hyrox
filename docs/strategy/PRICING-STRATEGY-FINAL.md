## 💡 Why This Pricing Works

### 1. No Free Tier = Quality Over Quantity
- HYROX athletes spend €130-220 per race - they're committed
- 30-day guarantee removes friction without "free forever" users
- Payment habit established from Day 1
- Better LTV, better retention

### 2. €19.99 Athlete = Psychological Sweet Spot
- Below WHOOP (€30) but premium to generic apps (€10)
- Aligns with Runna (€18), HWPO (€20)
- More accessible than €25 flat pricing
- Justifies AI-native specialization

### 3. Track Tier = Market Expansion
- Captures new segment (athletes with coaches)
- Low price point for analytics-only use case
- Easy upgrade path to full Athlete tier
- "Strava for HYROX" positioning

### 4. Pro Tier = Revenue Optimization
- 20-30% will pay premium (whales exist)
- Video analysis + race predictor = clear value add
- Drives 35-40% revenue from smaller base
- Launched later = lower complexity risk

### 5. Duo = Acquisition, Not Revenue
- €15/person CAC for TWO users
- Price increase prevents permanent discounting
- 1/year limit prevents gaming
- Converts to 2× individual revenue when partners rotate

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

1. ✅ **Kill free tier** → Replace with 30-day money-back guarantee
2. ✅ **€19.99 Athlete tier** → Not €25 (better psychology, more accessible)
3. ✅ **Add Track tier at €5.99** → Capture athletes with coaches, expand TAM
4. ✅ **Add Pro tier at €34.99** → Capture whales, launch later
5. ✅ **Duo at €30 → €40 after 12 months** → Acquisition tool with guardrails
6. ✅ **1 Duo per year limit** → Prevent gaming while allowing legitimate partner rotation
7. ✅ **Annual discount ~33%** → Drive commitment, reduce churn, capture revenue

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

### Duo Pack Protection:
1. **Price increase at 12 months** (€30 → €40)
   - Prevents permanent discounting
   - Forces decision: stay with partner or go solo

2. **1 Duo per user per year**
   - Prevents "Duo hopping" to stay at €15/person forever
   - Legitimate partner changes allowed annually

3. **No bypass option**
   - Keep it simple
   - Clear rules, no exceptions
   - If you want 2nd Duo in same year → wait or go solo

### Track Tier Protection:
- Clear positioning: "For athletes with existing programs"
- No AI training = obvious upgrade path to Athlete
- Low enough (€5.99) that cannibalization is minimal

## 💳 Payment System Implementation

### Recommended Stack: RevenueCat + Apple StoreKit 2

**Decision:** Use RevenueCat as the subscription management layer on top of Apple's StoreKit 2.

### Why RevenueCat (Not Pure Apple IAP)

| What You Get | Apple IAP Only | With RevenueCat |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Receipt validation | Build yourself (complex JWS tokens) | Automatic |
| Subscription status | Query Apple API, handle edge cases | One simple check |
| Webhooks (renewals, cancellations) | Parse & handle yourself | They handle it |
| Analytics (MRR, churn, LTV) | None | Full dashboard |
| Cross-platform ready | iOS only | iOS + Android + Web |
| Grace period handling | Build yourself | Automatic |
| A/B test pricing | Impossible | Built-in |

**The trade-off:** RevenueCat costs 1% of revenue (free up to €2,500 MTR), but saves 2-4 weeks of development + ongoing maintenance.

### Fee Structure

```
User pays:        €19.99/month
Apple takes:      €3.00 (15% - Small Business Program)
You receive:      €16.99
RevenueCat takes: €0.17 (1%)
You keep:         €16.82
```

**Apple Commission Rates:**
- 15% if under €1M/year revenue (Small Business Program)
- 15% on subscription renewals after first year
- 30% otherwise

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Launch (RevenueCat + Apple IAP)**
- Configure products in App Store Connect
- Integrate RevenueCat SDK
- Build native paywall UI
- Sync subscription status to Supabase
- Total fee: ~16% (15% Apple + 1% RevenueCat)

**Phase 2: Post-Launch (Add Stripe Web Checkout)**
- Add "Subscribe on Web" button (US only - Epic v. Apple ruling)
- Link to Stripe-hosted checkout
- RevenueCat syncs Stripe subscriptions automatically
- Total fee: ~4% (3% Stripe + 1% RevenueCat)
- Potential savings: 75% vs Apple IAP

**Phase 3: Growth (Add Superwall)**
- A/B test paywall designs without code changes
- Test IAP vs Web checkout conversion rates
- Optimize pricing and layout
- Free up to €10K MAR, then 1%

### Products to Configure

| Product ID | Type | Price | Trial |
|------------|------|-------|-------|
| `flexr_track_monthly` | Auto-renewable | €5.99/mo | 7 days |
| `flexr_track_annual` | Auto-renewable | €49.99/yr | 7 days |
| `flexr_athlete_monthly` | Auto-renewable | €19.99/mo | 7 days |
| `flexr_athlete_annual` | Auto-renewable | €179.99/yr | 7 days |
| `flexr_duo_monthly` | Auto-renewable | €30.00/mo | 7 days |
| `flexr_duo_annual` | Auto-renewable | €299.99/yr | 7 days |
| `flexr_pro_monthly` | Auto-renewable | €34.99/mo | 7 days |
| `flexr_pro_annual` | Auto-renewable | €299.99/yr | 7 days |

### Entitlements Structure

```
Entitlements:
├── track_access
│   └── Products: track_monthly, track_annual
├── athlete_access
│   └── Products: athlete_monthly, athlete_annual, duo_monthly, duo_annual
├── pro_access
│   └── Products: pro_monthly, pro_annual
└── duo_access
    └── Products: duo_monthly, duo_annual
```

### Code Example (RevenueCat)

```swift
// Check subscription status - ONE LINE
func checkSubscription() async -> Bool {
    let info = try? await Purchases.shared.customerInfo()
    return info?.entitlements["athlete_access"]?.isActive == true
}

// vs Apple IAP alone: 500+ lines of receipt validation code
```

### Best Practices

1. **Enable Billing Grace Period** in App Store Connect (reduces involuntary churn)
2. **Use Server Notifications** to keep subscription status in sync
3. **Implement Restore Purchases** (required by App Store guidelines)
4. **Show paywall early** but not aggressively (after value demonstrated)
5. **Offer annual prominently** (higher LTV, lower churn)
